University of Glasgow LaTeX Beamer template
Stephen D. Strowes, sdstrowes@gmail.com


The standard University of Glasgow talk templates for Powerpoint are
not pretty. This one is prettier, is not compliant with the
University's corporate image, and LaTeX means you can build out
simple slides easily.

The cover image is of the University's cloisters, beneath the Bute
Hall. It is my photo, and it is licensed under a Creative Commons
